# Star Wars Encyclopedia


### Some key points
- This is far from perfect and could be improved / refactored
- The queries must be improved and use fragments to prevent repeating the same thing
- Need more safe operator and error catching to prevent errors in a production app
- The style is as barebone as it gets


### Intructions
To start the app in development mode run: `npx expo start`
You need to have the expo cli installed before and the expo app installed on your device.

You should be able to run the project in the expo app with this link: `exp://exp.host/@cotetommy/StarWarsEncyclopedia`.

Let me know if this is not working, I can add you to the expo project.
